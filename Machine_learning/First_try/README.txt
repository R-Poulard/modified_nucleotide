In this first try we present each node with the following attributes
[reponse] what we want to predict
[parent] originel nodes (suppressed for some analysis beceause we show it induced a biais that lead to "too good prediction")
ENCODED IN ONE_HOT DURING THE PROCESSING
[nb_voisins] number of neighbors
[nb_voisins_modifi√©] number of modified neighbors
then follow 13 attributes on the different edges type the nucleotide have

To predict we use 3 different model (using scklearn)
-SVC
-KNearestClassification
-RandomTreeForst

We use a SearchGridCV each time to find the best parameters (base on f1 criterion) then score using 
-f1_score
-balanced accuracy score
-average precision score
-averege recall score


We tried 3 different optimizaiton:
[1] sub-sampling
[2] no subsampling #not done yet still running (or I gave up as the dataset is really big)
[3] sub-sampling wo the [parent] node
